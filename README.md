# PDF → EPUB Vision Pipeline

A prompt + orchestration design that converts a PDF book into a clean EPUB by
treating each rendered page as an **image a human reads**, not as a text stream
to reverse-engineer.

## Why this is different

Every mainstream PDF→EPUB tool (Calibre, Pandoc, pdf2epub, online converters)
parses the PDF's content stream — text spans, fonts, coordinates — and tries to
re-construct paragraphs, headings, and reading order geometrically. That breaks
on:

- multi-column layouts
- drop caps + small caps + italic lead-ins
- figures that wrap text
- chapter starts on arbitrary pages
- watermarks, running heads, page numbers bleeding into body text
- scanned books (no text stream at all)

This pipeline **renders each page to an image** at 200–300 DPI and hands it to a
vision LLM (`qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b`) along with the running book context. The
model sees what a reader sees, decides what is body / heading / figure / chrome,
and emits **semantic XHTML** wrapped in a strict JSON envelope.

A small orchestrator on your end stitches the pages into an EPUB, builds the
nav document, and runs a final QA pass.

## Quick start for an engine builder

1. Render every PDF page to PNG at 250 DPI. Name them `page-0001.png` …
2. Pick the architect sample set:
   - pages 1–6 (front matter + cover + first chapter start)
   - last 4 pages (back matter, last chapter end)
   - 8–12 evenly-spaced interior pages (sampling for structure confirmation)
3. Send those as one multi-image call → `prompts/architect.md` → parse → `book.json`
4. For each page in order, send a single-image call with `prompts/extract.md`
   (page image + `book.json` + the previous page's `<section>` so the model
   can continue mid-paragraph if a paragraph breaks across pages) → `page-NNNN.json`
5. Send the assembled chapter bundles to `prompts/assemble.md` → emits the
   final nav.xhtml + chapter XHTML files + cover image + metadata.opf
6. Zip the result with mimetype as the first entry → `.epub`

## Included engine

This repository includes a small Python engine, `pdf2epub.py`, wired for the
OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint:

- API base URL: `https://dav.smre.run.place/v1`
- Vision model: `qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b`

Set an API key with either `DAV_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`, then run:

```bash
python3 pdf2epub.py run "input.pdf" --work work --epub out/book.epub
```

Useful subcommands:

```bash
python3 pdf2epub.py render "input.pdf" --out work/pages --dpi 250
python3 pdf2epub.py architect --pages work/pages --out work
python3 pdf2epub.py extract --pages work/pages --book work/book.json --out work --concurrency 8
python3 pdf2epub.py assemble --book work/book.json --pages work/pages --epub out/book.epub
```

The engine sends page images as base64 `data:` URLs to
`/chat/completions`, requests `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}`, and
writes intermediate artifacts to `work/book.json` and `work/pages/page-NNNN.json`.
It uses Pillow to downsample rendered PNGs before sending them to the API.

## Model notes — qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b

This is a 397B MoE with 17B active, vision-capable. Practical properties:

- **Strong** at: structured JSON output, layout reasoning, OCR, multilingual.
- **Watch out for**: occasional JSON drift on long outputs, occasional
  hallucinated text when image is low-contrast, sometimes folds a header
  into body if the system prompt is weak.
- **Mitigations baked into these prompts**: rigid schema, explicit
  `[illegible]` marker, low temperature, `response_format: json_object`,
  short output budget per page, hard "no invented text" rule.

## Token budget

- Page image (250 dpi, A5-ish): ~800–1500 image tokens.
- Page extraction prompt (with context): ~1500–2500 text tokens.
- Page extraction response: ~600–2500 tokens.
- Total per page: ~3000–6000 tokens. For a 400-page book that's roughly
  1.5–2.4M tokens total. Plan a concurrency of 8–16 parallel page calls.
